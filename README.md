# Status
  Questions 1,2,4 are completed to the best of abilities. For each of those questions, individual .ipynb files are included in the respository with the file names as Qn{question_no}. Question 3 was not touched at all.
  
## Qn1
  A problem was faced with modifying existing plots. To overcome an additional external function called 'clear_output()' was imported from IPython.display. Other details are given in Qn1.ipynb. Externally the same plot though non-interactive was found in the wikipedia page, [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution#:~:text=In%20probability%20theory%20and%20statistics,normal%20distribution%20to%20higher%20dimensions).
A matlab code for the plot was also found at [link](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MultivariateNormal.png). These sites were viewed as some references.

## Qn2
  This question was completed the same way as described in the problem statement. No external resources were viewed.

## Qn4
  I had struggled with understanding the blackJAX sampling functions. In order to submit some solution, I have solved the problem only using the JAX library. Additional the posterior distribution is also plotted in this problem. I was familiar with likelihoods, priors and posteriors but I have not implemented bayesian linear regression before. Sites like [link 1](https://jessicastringham.net/2018/01/10/bayesian-linreg-plots/), [link 2](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-bayesian-linear-regression-e66e60791ea7) were viewed to get familiarized with the algorithm. But external resources were not referred for the implementation aspect of the algorithm.
